# 🧠 React.js Interview Preparation – Logic, OOP & Core Concepts

Welcome to this React.js interview preparation repository! 👋

This project is a compilation of real-world **interview questions** (both coding and theory) that I personally encountered while interviewing for a **React.js Developer role**. The goal of this repository is to help **frontend developers** prepare for technical assessments with hands-on code, clean solutions, and concise explanations.

## 📦 What's Inside?

This repo contains:

- ✅ Pure JavaScript coding challenges asked in interviews  
- ✅ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) implementation with classes and inheritance  
- ✅ Important theoretical concepts from HTML, CSS, and React.js  
- ✅ Code examples, best practices, and real-world integration (e.g., Google Maps API)
